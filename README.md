1. Write a program to Implement RB Tree supporting following operations:
	a. Insert a node
	b. Delete a node
	c. Search a number and report the color of node having this number
 2 tools are used in this rogram that are Recoloring and Rotation.
 this program is simply used for deletion insertion and searching and displaying the nodes having the same number that used have asked for.
 Searching in Red Black tree takes O(log N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
 
2. Using any greedy approach find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.
This program is used to find the minimun cost spanning for the given set of tree elements.
The time complexity of the Prim’s Algorithm is  because each vertex is inserted in the priority queue only once and insertion in priority queue take logarithmic time.

3. Implement Bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick sort. And count the number of comparisons in each case.
Firts we create the given sorts 
bubble sort  best-Ω(n)  average- θ(n^2)	worst-O(n^2)
insertion sort Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)	
merge sort Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
quick sort Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
selection sort Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
